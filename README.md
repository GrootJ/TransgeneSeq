# TransgeneSeq
Scripts of the targeted RNA-Seq Transgene Variant Analysis pipeline - as outlined and applied in the publication "Benchmarking and optimization of a Next Generation Sequencing based method for transgene Sequence Variant Analysis in Biotherapeutic Cell Line Development".

The outputs directory contains the pipeline output for the benchmarking datasets (mutation plots and mutation summary tables per NGS run ).

The sequence_references directory contains reference benchmarking MAb sequence fasta file and the corresponding gtf file indicating the MAb CDS annotation.

The raw fastq input data are hosted on NCBI's Sequence Read Archive PRJNA17890 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA717890/
